{"question": " What is the purpose of the NASA Scientific and Technical Information (STI) Program Office?", "answer": "The NASA STI Program Office . . . in Profile  Since its founding, NASA has been dedicated to the  advancement of aeronautics and space science. The  NASA Scientific and Technical Information (STI)  Program Office plays a key part in helping NASA  maintain this important role.  The NASA STI Program Office is operated by  Langley Research Center, the lead center for NASA’s  scientific and technical information. The NASA STI  Program Office provides access to the NASA STI  Database, the largest collection of aeronautical and  space science STI in the world. The Program Office is  also NASA’s institutional mechanism for  disseminating the results of its research and  development activities. These results are published by  NASA in tlie NASA STI Report Series, which  includes the following report types:  0 TECHNICAL PUBLICATION. Reports of  completed research or a major significant phase  of research that present the results of NASA  programs and include extensive data or  theoretical analysis. Includes compilations of  Significant scientific and technical data and  information deemed to be of continuing  reference value. NASA counterpart of peer-  reviewed formal professional papers, but having  less stringent limitations on manuscript length  and extent of graphic presentations.  0 TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM. Scientific  and technical findings that are preliminary or of  specialized interest, e.g., quick release reports,  working papers, and bibliographies that contain  minimal annotation. Does not contain extensive  analysis.  0 CONTRACTOR REPORT. Scientific and  technical findings by NASA-sponsored  contractors and grantees. CONFERENCE PUBLICATION. Collected  papers from scientific and technical  conferences, symposia, seminars, or other  meetings sponsored or co-sponsored by NASA.  SPECIAL PUBLICATION. Scientific,  technical, or historical information from NASA  programs, projects, and missions, often  concerned with subjects having substantial  public interest.  TECHNICAL TRANSLATION. English-  language translations of foreign scientific and  technical material pertinent to NASA’s mission.  Specialized services that complement the STI  Program Office’s diverse offerings iiiclude creating  custom thesauri, building customized databases,  organizing and publishing research results .. . even  providing videos.
