      "page_content='PREFACE  The Aerospace Mechanisms Symposium (AMS) provides a unique forum for those  active in the design, production and use of aerospace mechanisms. A major focus is  the reporting of problems and solutions associated with the development and flight  certification of new mechanisms. Organized by the Mechanisms Education Association,  the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and Lockheed Martin Space  Systems Company (LMSSC) share the responsibility for hosting the AMs. Now in its  38fh symposium, the AMS continues to be well attended, attracting participants from  both the US. and abroad.  The 38fh AMs, hosted by the Langley Research Center (LaRC) in Williamsburg,  Virginia, was held May 17, 18 and 19, 2006. During these three days, 34 papers were  presented. Topics included gimbals, tribology, actuators, aircraft mechanisms,  deployment mechanisms, release mechanisms, and test equipment. Hardware displays  during the supplier exhibit gave attendees an opportunity to meet with developers of  current and future mechanism components.  The high quality of this symposium is a result of the work of many people, and their  efforts are gratefully acknowledged. This extends to the voluntary members of the  symposium organizing committee representing the eight NASA field centers, LMSSC,  and the European Space Agency. Appreciation is also extended to the session chairs,  the authors, and particularly the personnel at LaRC responsible for the symposium  arrangements and the publication of these proceedings. A sincere thank you also goes  to the symposium executive committee who is responsible for the year-to-year  management of the AMs, including paper processing and preparation of the program.
