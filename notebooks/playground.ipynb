       "Document(page_content='88 between the locked and unlocked condition of the TO Isolators  during the landing impacts and assess LS-\\nDYNA® modeling techniques and predictive capability. The test configuration had a crew pallet-mockup \\n(green, Figure 7) suspended from a cage (yellow, Figure 7) via the eight struts simulating the Orion CM interior. The cage was housed in a ring base/support structure to provide adjustment for various landing parachute pitch angles. Vertical drop tests were conducted by releasing the test fixture from a crane hook at a height calculated to produce the desired impact velocity. Tapered stacks of paper honeycomb at the four corners of the test fixture base were used to produce impact pulses approximating Orion water landings (see Figure 7). Measurements recorded during the tests include TO Isolator displacements, forces and accelerations as well as pallet and cage accelerations. High-speed cameras and photogrammetry were used to verify impact conditions and observe TO behavior.   Eleven CIAS system drop tests were performed, which successfully demonstrated the performance of the system of struts and provided data for evaluation of the effect of the locked/unlocked condition. The accuracy of the LS-DYNA® model was also assessed. The tests featured impact velocities ranging from \\n3.05 - 10.7 m/s (10 - 35 ft/s) with the crew pallet locked at a 28\\no pitch angle. The findings from this test \\nand simulation effort are as follows: \\n 1. Strut force and pallet acceleration time histories can be predicted via LS-DYNA® simulations with a high degree of accuracy and are relatively insensitive to expected variations in strut parameters such as strut load limit levels, initial stiffness, and dead zones (initial slack). The load limit in the struts determines the peak acceleration of the pallet. The expected range of the strut force limits will result in a relatively minor variation in the strut forces and pallet accelerations.  2. The strut stroke is the most important parameter to consider for evaluation of the system response. It is also the most difficult output to predict, due to its high sensitivity to most input variables. Comparisons of test data with the LS-DYNA® simulation results for tests 3 through 11 had an average prediction error in the strut displacements of ±0.66 cm (0.26 in). The largest observed strut displacement error between a test and simulation was 3.8 cm (1.5 in). The overall average error was 20%. Accurate prediction of the strut strokes requires a high level of fidelity in the modeling of the structure to capture the flexural response of the crew pallet and the structure supporting the outboard ends of the struts, as well as very accurate modeling of the energy-absorbing wire bender strut force versus displacement curve.  3. Depending on the ratio of the load limit magnitude of the wire bender struts and the stiffness of the TO Isolator, there can be an amplification of the wire bender strut strokes for the unlocked condition. The testing revealed that there are combinations of wire bender struts and Isolator struts where the unlocked condition of the Isolator struts does not result in amplification of the wire bender strokes, and other combinations that can amplify the wire bender strokes by a factor of 2.5 to 3.0. These results confirmed the LS-DYNA® predictions that the Isolator needed to be in a locked configuration during landing.   4. The LS-DYNA® model is accurate enough to be used as an effective design tool for further CIAS studies. The design uncertainty on the pallet acceleration environment will reflect the expected variation in the strut yield force and is expected to be limited to 10% provided that the struts do not exceed their stroke limits. For the strut strokes, a design margin of 20% should be used.  ', metadata={'source': '../data/AMS/AMS_2012.pdf', 'page': 101})"

In order to meet the light attenuation requirements \\nand provide open and closed fields of view without breaking vacuum, a light shield mechanism was \\ndesigned.

The NIRSpec \\nfocal plane detectors require a light tight cover for calibration along with an open field-of-view during \\nground performance testing within a cryogenic dewar. These tests include exposing the detectors to \\ninfrared light for calibration in “darkness” while under vacuum at approximately 20 Kelvin \\n(-253°C). The darkness requirement is to maintain light levels less than 0.001 electron/sec/pixel at the \\ndetectors. In order to provide this low light level during calibration and also allow the detectors to be \\nexposed to the required light sources when needed, the light shield mechanism was developed. \\nRequirements \\nThe light shield mechanism is required to attenuate light in the chamber to a level less than 0.001 \\nelectronlseclpixel before it reaches the detectors.

The lifetime \\nrequirement for the shield is a few thousand cycles where one cycle is open and close. \\nWhen open, the shield door is to remain outside the 76-degree cone angle of the detectors’ field of view. \\nThe light shield door range of rotation is about 124 degrees from open to close. \\nShutter Light Path Design \\nA labyrinth light path is created, Figure 1, by the aligning of teeth-like protrusions on the shutter door with \\nteeth cut outs into the plate covering the detector housing, hereafter referred to as the dewar bulkhead. \\nThe door and dewar bulkhead protrusions are separated by a gap of 0.64 mm (0.025 in) to prevent any \\ncontact debris from being created during the opening and closing operation of the door. This gap allows \\nlight entrance to the path, however, the labyrinth design combined with the proper material selection and \\ntreatment forces any light entering to bounce many times off the path’s walls and thus be absorbed to \\nlevels below the requirement.

The GALEX latch arm was positioned close to the \\ninstrument aperture opening and was rotated away from the aperture to reduce stray light issues. The \\nrotation of the latch arm rotate introduced some potential single point failures. After the GALEX latch arm \\nwas adopted, it was discovered than an earlier mission that originally designed the Latch mechanism \\ninstead utilized a fixed latch arm with a slot in the path of cover deployment. Because the proposed \\ndesign did not face the same stray light issues as GALEX, a potential failure mode was unnecessarily \\nadopted and additional work was necessary to reduce risk. \\nThe Latch mechanism is zero-fault tolerant in some cases as it depends on a single actuator (with \\nredundant heaters) and a single set of pistons to translate prior to cover deployment. An alternate latch \\nmechanism design using two Starsys pin pullers in a toggle type configuration could have been more \\ndesirable and would have been fully single fault tolerant.

       "  Document(page_content='Heritage Adoption Lessons Learned: Cover Deployment and Latch Mechanism \\nJames W incentsen. \\nAbstract \\nWithin JPL, there is a technology thrust need to develop a larger Cover Deployment and Latch \\nMechanism (CDLM) for future missions. The approach taken was to adopt and scale the CDLM design as \\nused on the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) project. The three separate mechanisms that comprise \\nthe CDLM will be discussed in this paper in addition to a focus on heritage adoption lessons learned and \\nspecific examples. These lessons learned will be valuable to any project considering the use of heritage \\ndesigns. \\nIntroduction \\nBecause of future JPL mission needs for meter class space telescopes, there was an internal technology \\ndemonstration to develop a complete mechanism set for single-time deployable cover to protect the \\noptics. Because the task was tracked for a fast technology development, the decision was made to fully \\nadopt the GALEX cover deployment design early in the project cycle to save cost and schedule. For \\nreference, the baseline design aperture opening diameter was 0.83 m (32.7 in) and the outer diameter of \\nthe instrument was 1.1 m (43.3 in) in diameter, roughly twice the size of GALEX. \\nCDLM Overview \\nThe three mechanisms that comprise the CDLM are the Latch, Hinge, and two Energy Absorbers. When \\nthe Latch releases the cover, two push off springs and the Hinge mechanism rotate the cover \\napproximately 4.66 rad (267 deg) and impact the crushable honeycomb filled Energy Absorbers. \\nDeployment time is approximately 3.4 seconds. The Hinge mechanism is un-dampened. After \\ndeployment, the cover remains against the canister. An overview of the instrument and placement of the \\nmechanisms are presented in Figure 1. \\nLatch Mechanism \\nThe Latch mechanism, attached to the cover, employs a Starsys paraffin thermal actuator as the prime \\nmover. An interfacing slotted Latch Arm is affixed to the Cover Ring. The Latch Arm is spring loaded to \\nrotate away from the aperture opening upon release. A detail view of the latch area is shown in Figure 2, \\nthe Latch Arm is shown in Figure 3, and a cross section of the Latch mechanism is shown in Figure 4. \\nThe Locking Piston passes through and retains the Latch Arm. The Push Piston has a small-diameter tip \\nand passes through the Latch Arm slot. To deploy the cover, the actuator heater is energized, which \\ntranslates both the Push Piston and Locking Piston, forcing the Locking Piston clear of the Latch Arm. \\nOnce the Locking Piston is clear of the Latch Arm, the Push Piston slips through the Latch Arm as it \\nrotates. The mechanism locks open by means of torsion spring loaded arms that snap into a grove on the \\nLocking Piston. Microswitches sense the motion of the arms and provide telemetry of the mechanism \\nstate. \\nPower to the actuator is discontinued once one of three criteria are meet: Hall effect sensors mounted on \\nthe Energy Absorbers register a deployed cover (discussed later), PRTs mounted on the actuator reach a \\nmaximum temperature, or a time limit circuit is exceeded. Both the temperature and time are based on a \\nlook up table derived from thermal vacuum Latch test data.

Breadboard model of the Sphere \\nTechnical Challenges Overcome \\nStruaalina for a low mass \\nThe total mass allocated to the Martian seismometer, including sphere, installation device and \\nelectronics, is 2.4 kg. The mass budget allocated to the sphere is only 540 g. \\nAt the end of this Phase 6, we managed to get very close to the mass budget with 570 g, which \\nalmost ensures matching the specification mass in a phase C.
