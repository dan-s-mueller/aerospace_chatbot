There was a plan for a  more in-depth flex -body analysis, however this wasn't completed in time and the team proceeded into development testing. During development testing, numerous structural and life tests were conducted on the latch mechanisms. One lesson learned was that spring force hysteresis needs to be taken into consideration for complex mechanical systems, as spring force can drop by 10%-20% due to interactions with other parts of the system. A specific example of a latch mechanism failure investigation was that of a static load test of a single latch. After the failure, a fishbone diagram was constructed which highlighted more than 50 possible root cause contributors and further analysis was conducted. The originally planned flex -body analysis was given new urgency, and new software models and tools were used to analyze the cause of the failure.\""

            "One lesson learned was the importance of considering spring hysteresis in the design. Spring hysteresis refers to the loss of spring force after cycling. The development testing confirmed that the spring force dropped by 10% - 20% after cycling. This hysteresis loss was compensated for in Moog's new latch system, which accounted for all environmental conditions and provided repeatable performance. The lesson here is that initial design development should include the consideration of spring force hysteresis losses.\n",
            "\n",
            "Another lesson learned was the need for accurate modeling and analysis of complex latch mechanisms with many parts. The initial analysis of the latch design was limited to standard FEM/stress modeling and rigid-body kinematic studies, which showed positive results. However, it was found that accurate modeling of complex mechanisms, especially with flex-body effects, may not always be possible or feasible. This lesson emphasizes the importance of testing early and using analysis results cautiously.\n",
            "\n",
            "One specific failure encountered in the latch mechanism design was related to pressure deflections. The Apollo-like latch trains used in the design were found to be more sensitive to pressure deflections from the new flat Orion hatch structure. This failure mode could have been identified with additional independent analysis in the early design stages. The lesson here is to thoroughly understand the effects of requirements when using pre-existing designs and to conduct additional analysis to identify potential failure modes.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the development testing phase, a failure occurred in the latch mechanism. The investigation into the failure involved creating a fishbone failure diagram and considering more than 50 possible root cause contributors. The latch strain gauges showed non-linearity near the point of failure, which was unexpected. The leading root cause theories were that the latches were not behaving as over-center mechanisms and that the engaged LRA (Locking and Retention Assembly) should have acted as a backup structural path to prevent latches from backdriving. Further analysis and testing with improved instrumentation were deemed necessary to determine the exact cause of the failure.\n",

The lessons learned include considering spring hysteresis in the design, conducting accurate modeling and analysis of complex mechanisms, understanding the effects of requirements when using pre-existing designs, and ensuring sufficient instrumentation is used to identify and characterize failure modes during testing.\n",
