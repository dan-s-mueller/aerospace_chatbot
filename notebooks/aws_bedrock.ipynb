      "- {'content': {'text': '# Spacecraft Mechanism Testing in the Molsink Facility ## Introduction This paper describes the 10-ft Space Molecular Sink Simulator Facility (Molsink), now operational at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and its uses. The triple-wall construction combines an extreme-high-vacuum capability (10^-8 torr) with an anechoic configuration. The inner wall is cooled to 14°K and coated with evaporated titanium to effect a very high capture coefficient for all gas molecules. Even helium may be captured by this wedge fin molecular trap. To date, three Mariner Mars 1969 mechanisms have been tested, and the first phase of a cooperative JPL, TRW, and U.S. Air Force study of friction phenomena has been completed. Some experiments have been performed for the study of microbial death in the space environment. A program has also been started to define the density profile of rocket plumes at high vacuums. Within the next year, it is planned to complete the experiments above and to perform calibration tests on various lunar atmosphere mass spectrometers and development tests of several Mariner Mars 1971 mechanisms. A Molsink calibration and evaluation program, which was started several months ago but deferred because of the press of flight project tests, is now planned to be completed by July 1969.'}, 'location': {'s3Location': {'uri': 's3://aerospace-chatbot-ams-demo/AMS_1969_reocr_chunk_2.pdf'}, 'type': 'S3'}, 'metadata': {'x-amz-bedrock-kb-source-uri': 's3://aerospace-chatbot-ams-demo/AMS_1969_reocr_chunk_2.pdf', 'x-amz-bedrock-kb-data-source-id': 'NVGEOHAB2X'}}\n",

      "{'text': 'The Molsink facility at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory is a 10-foot diameter triple-walled extreme-high-vacuum chamber designed to test spacecraft mechanisms. It features walls that use both cryogenic and chemical pumping to handle gases produced during testing. The facility can achieve vacuum levels of 10^-8 torr and has inner walls cooled to 14°K. A key feature of the Molsink is its ability to simulate the molecular sink effect of space. This is measured by the Molsink Factor, which represents the ratio of molecules leaving a test item compared to those returning to it. The facility is highly efficient - for every 10,000 molecules that leave a test item, only a few return to it. The facility uses a Molecular Trap (Moltrap) constructed of aluminum sheets welded to aluminum tubes, cooled by a 1200-W helium refrigerator. It also employs an electron-beam titanium sublimator for chemical pumping. The facility has been used to test Mariner Mars 1969 mechanisms, conduct friction phenomena studies, examine microbial death in space environments, and study rocket plume density profiles at high vacuums.'}\n"
