What is the impact of pull-out strengths for inserts in Al-1100 on joint designs?,"['Table 2 summarizes the calculation for the total UF to be applied to the nominal preload loss at room  temperature for the heat strap flight joints at specified intervals after re-torque. It is noted that re-torque  decreases UF− from 0.69 to 0.52 for the expected minimum preload after 5 years. Calculations are based  on a torque/preload UF of 0.36, which was determined from a separate nut factor test for this bolt/insert  flight configuration.  Table 2.

The flight joints  include threaded inserts embedded in Al-1100, washers bearing directly on high purity aluminum foils, and  indium gaskets. Al-1100 is known to creep under load at room temperature and indium gaskets can  gradually flow out of a bolted interface. The results of the test and post-test processing of the data show  that the flight joints can lose ~ 25% of its initial preload (average+2-sigma) in 5 years after initial torque  application. A relative high torque/preload UF of 0.36 was also determined based on a separate test for  bolts with threaded inserts in Al-1100. Combining the results from the joint relaxation test and a separate  torque/preload test, a total uncertainty factor of 0.52 was calculated for the minimum expected preload in a  flight joint five years after initial torque-up. In other words, the minimum expected preload five years after  initial torque application is 52% of the nominal installation preload. The test and data analysis results  presented in this report has been applied to the JWST heat strap attachment joint analysis for predicting  preloads and checking thermal performance requirements.  Several observations are noted from the test results and curve fits. The largest relaxation drivers in the heat  strap joints are (1) threaded inserts embedded in Al-1100 and (2) washers bearing directly on high purity  aluminum foils. Also, pull-out strengths for inserts in Al-1100 are low due to the very low shear strength of  the parent material which further reduces the design space for the attachment joints. It is recommended  that threaded inserts in Al-1100 are avoided if possible in future joint designs. Alternate options for joints  requiring Al-1100 members for thermal performance could include nuts or nut plates. The test results also  demonstrate the benefit of re-torqueing bolts in joints that include indium gaskets. For the indium and flight  joint coupons, re-torque after initial torque-up reduced the total preload loss (5 years out) by ~50%.  Caution must be exercised when applying the results from this test to joint configurations that deviate from  the JWST heat strap joint designs (material, initial torque, indium gasket, bolt size, etc.). It is recommended  that the results in this report are not directly applied to other joints configurations, but may be used for  guidance and insight when designing joints with similar configuration.

What is the advantage of using a complex magnet configuration in a magnet assembly?,"['the smallest temperature coefficient is preferred. Similarly, radiations that can induce  demagnetization must be limited.   Magnet material The field intensity requirement imposes the use of rare earth magnets (meaning that one of the components is a lanthanide). The common compounds are NdFeB or SmCo. In general, NdFeB have a higher residual field (from 1 to 1.4 T instead of 0.8 to 1.1 T for SmCo) but this advantage is largely degraded by the other characteristics. First, SmCo has a smallest temperature coefficient (the reversible magnetism in SmCo decreases by 0.04 %/°C, which is about 10 times less than in NdFeB), higher Cure temperature and higher irreversible point (around 300°C for SmCo against 100°C for NdFeB), and therefore is less prone to irreversible loss of magnetism. As mentioned above, these effects are unwanted because a non-uniform demagnetization may lead to a change in the field orientation. Second, SmCo withstand radiation 2 to 40 times better than NdFeB. Finally, even though SmCo material is brittle and fragile, it is more resistant to corrosion and has a high resistance to oxidation. SmCo with the highest grade (corresponding to a higher coercively) are favorable to further improve the long-term stability. Among the highest grades, grade 28 is usually commercially available and is therefore a suitable material. The compound composition is Sm2Co17 and the blocks are fabricated by sintering. Its characteristics are listed in Table 1.   Table 1. Properties of SmCo28 \n\nSingle magnet configuration   For production and magnetization simplicity the magnet assembly must consist of simple basic blocks (parallelepiped, cylinders, etc), with the magnetic moment orients and aligned with one edge. For illustration, we show the performances obtained with a simple parallelepiped block (20 x 20 x 10 mm (x-y-z), magnetized along the x-axis). Figure 9 shows the field intensity and the HR as a function of the distance z from the magnet surface.  Figure 9. Field intensity (left) and homogeneity radius of a 20 x 20 x10 mm single block magnet \n\nAt 2 mm from the above single magnet surface (reasonable position of the sensor), the field intensity is around 140 mT and the homogeneity radius is 0.5 mm. These values comply with the homogeneity and  intensity requirements. But the stray field distance is relatively large: 85 mm. Better performances in more  compact configuration can be achieved with more complex magnet configurations. \n\nComplex magnet configuration\n\nThe main idea is to constructively superpose the field from different magnet at the sensor location and  destructively superpose at the outside. An arrangement known to allow this is the “Halbach” array [7].  Cylindrical Halbach array produce an intense field in a limited region and have a small stray distance because the total magnetic moment is zero. For the desired high accuracy, one suitable configuration consists in a Halbach crown made of 8 cubes, as shown in Figure 10. With fewer blocks, some volume is lost and with more blocks, the elementary cube is too small and the field intensity decreases (it is roughly  proportional to the cube volume) [RD5]. A stack of two such crowns improves the field homogeneity and  gives some displacement freedom along the z-axis (rotation axis).

What is the main component for installing all the elements needed for the Cubesat's operation in the shielding panel?,"[""490 Mechanism Background \n\nThis deployment mechanism is based on one main part, called the sub-chassis, which is designed to be  built from a polymer using fast prototyping. All the elements needed for the mechanism's operation are installed onto this piece. This includes the antenna enveloping film, the burning resistance, and the opening detection switch. The sub-chassis can itself be installed in the shielding panel on one side of the Cubesat, which means that everything is easily inserted in a modular way.   Operation is very simple. The retention film is attached to the sub-chassis and allows the antennas to be folded and retained against the edge of the sub-chassis. Once the assembly is closed, a nylon wire passes through both the film and the antennas, and it is this that keeps everything folded away until the time for burning. At that moment, the burning resistance will cut the retention wire and the antennas will be deployed, leaving the retention film joined to the sub-chassis unable to detach itself.  \n\nFigure 1.  Final Deployment Mechanism  \n\nGeneral view of the Mechanism   General operation is, as mentioned above, basically the same as before. The main difference lies in the fact that the enveloping film, instead of being fixed to the sub-chassis together with one of the antennas with which it was in direct contact, is now attached independently onto the sub-chassis. This way avoids problems related to the noise that could be produced on the antenna, but which requires a new nut and bolt to be included.  Furthermore, the enveloping film attachment moves from point S on the sub-chassis to point E. This is due to the fact that if it were attached at point S, the end of the antenna attached at point E would end beyond the retention point. The pressure from the retention wire would thus lead to this unpressed end opening towards the outside in such a way that it would exceed the limit given by the available envelope. In compensation, the film is roughly 80 mm longer. It needs to be perforated twice for the retention wire to pass through, which means its capacity for retention is much greater precisely because it passes twice over the retention point and none of the antenna's parts are left with no pressure against the sub-chassis. \n\nSub-chassis \n\nThe sub-chassis, as stated above is the cornerstone of this mechanism. Its special features allow it to be extremely light and act as the piece that enables the installation of all the other mechanism elements. This means it is of vital importance for endowing the assembly with modularity and simplicity.

Why are nanocomposite sputter-deposited MoS2 coatings used on the FAM in the NIRCam of the James Webb Space Telescope?,"['221 Degradation of Sputter -Deposited Nanocomposite   MoS 2 Coatings for NIRCam during Storage  in Air  \n\nJeffrey  R. Lince,* Stuart H. Loewenthal ** and Charles S. Clark**  \n\n    Abstract  \n\nThe Focus and Alignment Mechanism (FAM) in NIRCam  on the J ames Webb Space Telescope will be  lubricated with nanocomposite sputter -deposited MoS 2 coatings . To respond to concerns regarding how  exposure to humid air during storage would affect performance, a study was conducted involving real -time  (i.e., unaccelerated) storage of coatings in air at 59% RH  for over two years . Pin-on-disk friction testing  showed that the endurance of the coatings dropped significantly during storage, but still provided  acceptabl e margin for FAM. The endurance results correlated well with X -ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy  results that measured the conversion of MoS 2 to nonlubricating MoO 3 during storage.  \n\nNIRCam Background  \n\nNanocomposite sputter -deposited MoS 2 coatings are being used to lubricate sliding surfaces within the  Focus and Alignment Mechanism (FAM) in the Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam); NASA chose NIRCam as  one of four science instruments for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) (See Figure 1).1 The three  FAM s are linear actuators  required to provide micron level  positioning in tip, tilt and piston to the Pickoff  Mirror that reflects the starlight  into the rest of the NIRC am instrument. The FAM,  along with the other  NIRCam mechanisms such as the filter wheel assembly and pupil imaging assembly , are required to  operate at approximately 37K for near infrared imaging during the 5- year JWST mission .2    The FAM consist s of a fine pitch lead screw driven by 3 -phase stepper motor through a high- ratio Harmonic  Drive.  It was required to pass a cryogenic 2X life test of 200,000 revolutions with repeatable position  accuracy of less than 4 microns and with less  than a 30% increase in threshold motor  current. These  demanding requirements and the need to op erate at cryogenic temperatures put a high premium on  selecting durable solid lubricant  films.  Sputter -deposited nanocomposite MoS 2-based coatings  manufactured by Hohman Plating, Inc. were chosen for this application.  \n\nBecause of the high precision nature of the FAM, the plan was to store the flight article in either a vacuum  or a dry nitrogen purged environment during ground processing after delivery. This represented a conservative position due to the known sensitivity of the MoS 2 lubricant to humidity. However, providing  such an environment proved to be impractical after integration with the next higher assembly , where it will  be stored in air with 30 to 60% RH . Although non- reversible degradation of MoS 2 in the coatings to oxides  is expected in poorly controlled storage environments, the specific amount of degradation over long periods of time has not been quantified.    Sputter -deposited MoS 2-based coatings are increasingly being used in spacecraft applications where solid  lubricant formulations based on MoS 2 powders are precluded.3 Sputter -deposited coatings differ from such  coatings in that they are thin (i.e., ~0.5– 1 μm thick), have smaller crystallite sizes, higher crystalline defect  levels, and do not use bonding agents. In their pure form, sputtered coatings exhibit significant sensitivity  to oxidation in humid atmospheres. However, i mprovements in wear life have been achieved by cosputtering MoS 2 with vari ous species4-7 to form nanocomposites  (as are used in the FAM) , or forming  multilayer coatings by alternating deposition of a metal with MoS 2.8 These mixed coatings should exhibit                                                    * The Aerospace Corporation, El Segundo, CA   ** Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company , Sunnyvale, CA  \n\nProceedings of the 43rd Aerospace Mechanisms Sym posium, NASA Ames Research Center, May 4-6, 2016']","Nanocomposite sputter-deposited MoS2 coatings are used on the FAM in the NIRCam of the James Webb Space Telescope to lubricate sliding surfaces and provide micron level positioning in tip, tilt, and piston to the Pickoff Mirror.",reasoning,"[{'page': 235, 'source': 'AMS_2016.pdf', 'filename': 'AMS_2016.pdf'}]",True
