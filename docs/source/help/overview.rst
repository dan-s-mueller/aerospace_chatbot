Overview
========

There is an overwhelming amount of information available to aerospace engineers. This information is often scattered across many different sources, and it can be difficult to find the information you need. The difficulty usually comes in the form of proprietary information or unstructured data. Normally, this is in report form which is already in or can be put into a PDF format. Furthermore, older information from NASA, SMC, or the Air Force will come in this form and is not well indexed for new space companies. 

aerospace_chatbot intents to provide a better way of accessing this type of information that comes in PDF formats, using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and large language models to access and question data in a more natural way.

TODO: add a picture of the RAG methodology

TODO: add reference to the streamlit_app page which examples of how to use
