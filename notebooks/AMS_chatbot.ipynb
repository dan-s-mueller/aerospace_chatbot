            "\n",
            "The Orion side hatch design underwent a development test program that identified deficiencies in the design. One of the key components of the side hatch is the aluminum structural panel. Initially, a trade study was conducted to compare a flat structure with a curved structure (similar to the Apollo design). The flat structure was chosen to improve sealing tolerances and reduce cost. However, during development testing, it was discovered that the flat structure introduced new pressure-deflection problems, which would have reduced system reliability if not corrected.\n",
            "\n",
            "Another important component of the side hatch is the latch system. Two latch trains, known as the \"A\" train and \"B\" train, with a total of 17 latches, are used to compress the perimeter seals and retain the hatch to the spacecraft structure. Due to increased strength margins and higher pressures required for Orion, the latches were scaled up significantly compared to Apollo. The latches are over-center mechanisms linked together through a series of linkages and bell cranks. The goal is for the latches to be driven further over-center into the hardstops as hatch pressure loads increase. However, achieving the desired hardstop conditions proved to be extremely difficult due to part tolerances and the interactive nature of the latch linkages.\n",
            "\n",
            "Lessons learned from the Orion side hatch development include:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Accurate modeling of complex mechanisms with many parts may not be possible or feasible. Analysis results should be used cautiously, and early testing is crucial.\n",
            "2. Using pre-existing designs without thoroughly understanding the effects of new requirements can lead to unforeseen problems. Additional independent analysis in the early design stages could have identified failure modes.\n",
            "3. Anticipating failure scenarios during testing and ensuring sufficient instrumentation is used to identify and characterize failure modes is important. Cameras should be used even for simple structural tests.\n",
            "4. Successful subcomponent tests may not guarantee success in higher-level assembly tests for complex mechanical systems.\n",
            "5. Rigging procedures for complex assemblies should be well-documented with clear pass/fail criteria on critical dimensions and features.\n",
            "6. Verifying the state of mission-critical mechanical functions is crucial. In the case of the Orion side hatch, the state of the gearbox latch restraint arm was not properly established during development testing.\n",
            "\n",
            "Overall, the deficiencies in the side hatch design were identified and corrected for the first uncrewed Artemis 1 mission. The gearbox inspection and hatch rigging procedures were updated, resulting in successful completion of the side hatch protoflight testing and integration into the spacecraft.\n",
