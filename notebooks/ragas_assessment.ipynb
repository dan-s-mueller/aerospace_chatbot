Operator effort was reduced by modifying the width and thickness of the spring beam members to lower the latch/reset force.

Dimensional allowances were adjusted at the beam-to-latch pin contact point to prevent galling, and texturing of mating surfaces was avoided due to aggravating galling issues.', 'verdict': '1'}\n"
