       "Document(page_content='92 REACT Qualification C ampaign  \\n \\nA complete qualification campaign has been defined for each model and temperature variant, for a total of \\n6 campaigns. Eac h campaign includes 3 different units covering different mechanical interfaces for the \\ncustomers. Figure 7 summarizes the qualification campaign sequence for each variant.  \\n \\n \\nFigure 7. REACT Qualification Campaign  \\n \\nThe qualification campaigns of the REACT 5kN and 15kN Standard Temperature  units  have already been \\ncompleted, while the rest of campaigns are on- going. The main results and findings are:  \\n• The units are being qualified to a lifetime over 50 cycles, which enables for at least 10 cycles on \\nground and one in orbit, according to ECSS. Extension to 70 cycles during qualification to enable up \\nto 15 on ground uses is being implemented on new campaigns. REACT 15kN Standard temperature \\nhas already completed its qualification for 70 cycles.  \\n• All the units withst ood their proof load (6.5 kN, 19 kN and 43.5 kN, respectively) with high stiffness \\nand were able to release even under  such preloads. Axial stress tests have shown that the strength \\nof each unit are well above the specification values . REACT 5kN has shown a strength over 18 kN, \\nwhere the test resulted in external bolt fracture without any sign of damage to the device, which was \\nstill showing normal behavior actuating in nominal conditions. The REACT 15kN test r esulted in the \\nbreakage of the external bolt at 45 kN and the device show ed nominal behavior after the test. In the \\ncase of REACT 35kN,  a maximum preload of 100 kN  was reached, at which point  the interface \\nbetween the bolt and the tensile machine was broken. The unit was still fully  operative after such \\nload. These values show the robustness of the design and a high confidence in the device mechanical \\nstrength due to the application of design margins.  \\n• Vibration and shock environment s were succesfully applied to  all the models, show ing that the device \\nholds the rated  load without issues.  \\n• The units were subjected to 6 thermal cycles over the operating range, followed by actuations at low \\nand high temperature extremes . The devices showed good behavior during the cycling and actuated  \\nsuccessfully.  \\n• Misalignment and creep tests were  performed to characterize the devices . The results during \\nmisalignment tests show ed that the units were able to accomodate half-cone angles of more than \\n4.5º during integration and release. Creep tests were run for more than 6 months succesfully, showing \\nvery low initial preload loss followed by stabilization . Nominal actuation has been achieved after the \\ntest. Creep test s are being extended to 12 months.  \\n• Force margin tests have been completed by assembli ng SMA initiators with  a fraction of the nominal \\ncross- section, and therefore a fraction of the available output force. This way, the force margins of \\n', metadata={'source': '../data/AMS/AMS_2020.pdf', 'page': 101})"
