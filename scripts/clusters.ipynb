      " their effective length and maximizing the elastic stiff ness with high-modulus materials ( e.g. , titanium ) . This also proved to be beneficial for thermal stability since it minimized the length of the higher CTE materials . Distributed preload sy stems were used in most applications since it was not practical from a mass and cost standpoint to have an independent preload device for each latch interface . However , the preload mechanisms were designed to be much more compliant than the interface fittings which transfer the operational loads . Providing this compliance keeps the preload device out of the primary stiffness path and maintains a relatively constant preload across the interfaces . Primary Mirror The primary mirror deployment and latch mechanisms consist of a pair of hinges and four latches for each wing . The deployment hinges and wing latches act as independent systems . Wing Deployment Hinges The hinges have a dual function . First , the hinges , along with two launch restraint mechanisms , carry the wing launch loads . Second , they rotate the wings 103 degrees into the capture range of the deployed wing latches . The wing deployment sequence is shown in Figure 5 . Each hinge has a pair of lug and clevis fittings joined by a loose hinge pin providing redundant rotating surfaces . The hinge pin has sufficient clearance to the lug and clevis fittings to preclude it from being in the load path after the , Figure 1.ISIS1/=-Scale Model Background Thewirebrakewasdesigned toenablethecontrolled deployment ofaninflatable boom .

      " The clamper plate provides a constant clamping force to the motor actuator enabling zero power hold . The clamping plate is on a pivot and it therefore transfers the clamping force from the active clamp to the static clamp – leading to an operating condition where the clamping force is always present . DSM ’ s architecture also provides a much more consistent and significantly higher clamping magnitude than in the traditional step and repeat motor . For exampl e , DSM recently developed a high-force IMPULSE PiezoMotor™ with approximately 2000 N peak force ( called IMPULSE 2000 for short ) and 20 mm/s peak unloaded speed . Compare this to a COTS piezomotor linear actuator from EXFO ( 2007 ) with 9.8 N peak force and 1.5 mm/s peak speed . For low-force applications and a small package , DSM is developing an IMPULSE 30 ( 30 N of force ) with 32 mm/s drive speed . IMPULSE PiezoMotor™ mechanism details and factors that affect the force and step size are presented relative to the components shown in Figure 3 . Experi mental testing results are also discussed . Sideplates ( dashed ) provide rigid support of each end of shaft Extender drives active clamp back andforth relative to static clamp Active clamp clamps while lifting clamper plateStatic ClampClamper Plate transfers clamp action back and forth with each step Friction Interfaces produces force between clamps and clamper plate frame Figure 3 – Operational Components And Mechanisms In DSM ’ s Step And Repeat Motor Motor Drive Force , 62 Tests with older curved rotors using the M-15 stator also showed the same excellent results indicating that the issue was with the CP49 material and not anything else . The lesson learned here is that FEA analysis is a path towards good designs but is not the end all . Practical machines with practical materials must ultimately be the final say . We stayed with the flat magnets because we had purchased the entire programs supply . In retrospect , had we had been able to have gone with the M-15 material ( usually our preferred material for this type of motor ) most of these delays and perturbations relative to the harmonics would not have occurred or been necessary . A photo of the G motor is shown in Figure 13 . The data in Figure 12 shows the distortion improvement with the M-15 material from 2.79 % to 1.57 % .

      " 467 Device # 2 is another shape memory alloy device . This device uses a shape memory alloy to actuate a ball detent mechanism which releases a deployable item . Its load capacity is far beyond what is needed for many CubeSats or small instruments . It uses very little power and has an almost instantaneous actuation . It ’ s also much larger and more massive than could be used in this APL CubeSat . It draws far more current than a CubeSat could supply without dedicated capacitor banks . While it produces much less shock than a pyrotechnic device , it still produces shock , which must be evaluated in the design process . Device # 3 uses a resistive heater that heats paraffin wax . When the wax is heated , it expands . The actuators are designed to produce linear motion with a defined output force . They are compact , highly reliable , and insensitive to contamination . They require a companion mechanism to affect the release of a deployable device . They consume much more energy than any other device compared . Device # 4 uses shape memory alloy wires to rotate a cam which allows a four segment nut to separate and release a bolt . They have a much higher load capacity than is needed for the reference application . They use very little energy and are near-instantaneous actuators .

      " Theaccommodation ofstructural deflections caused bythetemperature gradients wasoneofthemost important considerations indesigning thetrussattachment system . Estimates ofthetemperature distributions weremadeusingISSthermal models ofboththepre-mate andpost-mated conditions . Transient thermal analysis wasusedtodetermine trusstemperatures atthepointintimewhenthemating wasexpected tooccur.Numerous flightattitudes , sunangles , hardware configurations , shadowing , and 201 , protection for the mechanism . •Assess other environmental impacts such as temperature and vacuum where possible . Often the impact is smaller than the impact of mechanical environmental tests . However , it is recommended to assess these effects on at least one unit . •Test ALL units . Small build to build variability can lead to significant microvibration performance changes , as demonstrated in Figure 1 . Case study : Verification by test for a large rotating scanner In order to demonstrate some of the issues with verification by test , one specific case study is discussed here . The force versus frequency requirement shown in Figure 5 is actually applicable on a large rotating scanning instrument . Verification by test is specified for this requirement . The scanner mass is 200-300 kg , with a rotating mass of more than half of the total mass . The scanner is designed to rotate at a constant speed of < 1 Hz . When comparing the requirement to the specification of state of the art test facilities ( Figure 12 ) , several , To remain consistent with prior NASA Goddard practice , torque resistances were updated using the more conservative “ Zero-Neutral ” approach for characterization of the harnesses , wherein the net resistance is the sum of the worst case deploying torque at beginning of rotation plus the worst-case stowing torque at the end of rotation . The use of non-flight harness in tests also arose as an issue because of the natural variability of wire geometry within their respective harnesses . Without photographic or other proof that the original test harnesses were essentially the same , re-testing of freshly built flight-like harnesses was mandated . This testing measured the actual harness route of the RDA and compared it to the test harness that was built . The results of this testing showed that the test harness matched the behavior of the flight harness . The “ Zero-Neutral ” approach changed the resistive torque of this harness from a resistive torque value of 0.17 N-m ( 1.5 in-lb ) used from the harness testing done in 2004 to 2.26 N-m ( 20 in-lb ) . The IPH1 hinge line harness resistance values were changed from 0.23 N-m ( 2.0 in-lb ) to 0.76 N-m ( 6.7 in-lb ) , and the IPH2 hinge line values were updated to 0.37 N-m ( 3.3 in-lb ) . The changes in these harness values and applying the required factors of safety drove the torque margins to negative values reported in Table 2 . During the 2009 investigation on the characterization of the torque output of the hinges it was found that , Errors due to poor com munication crept.\n",

The wear behavior was not fully consistent for this set of four tests . In two cases there was moderate wear by the end of test . For these two tests the steel rollers lost mass and the Ti6Al4V rollers gained nearly equal mass . The mass change was of the order 0.020 gram for each roller of the two tests having moderate wear . For the other two tests with minor wear , the roller mass changes were nearly an order of magnitude less compared to the two tests with moderate wear . The photograph of Figure 6 ( h ) shows a representative end-of-test condition for this configuration . Considering the four tests of this configuration as one grouping , the adhesive wear phenomenon wasdelayed and the overall wear rate was reduced as compared to tests without a solid lubricant film . The reasons for the differing behaviors of the four tests of this configuration have not been determined conclusively . For one of the two tests with moderate wear , the coating thickness was about one-half of the intended thickness because of a temporary problem with the coating process . The thinner film was likely at least partially responsible for the less effective wear protection . From scanning-electron microscope inspections , for the other test with moderate wear , little transfer of sputtered film to the mating , validation , and the parameters chosen are speculative as shown here . A mathematical model that can forecast such turn-down was described . The life degradation associated with the artificially damaged bearings amounted to a 95 % reduction of the median life compared with the baseline ( as-manufactured ) counterparts .

The system is designed to be relatively straightforward to implement in a customer design . The readhead and code disk/hub are first mounted , usually with pinned or piloted interfaces .

Exact rotational speed and/or speed stabilit y are not critical for these sweeps . The preliminary data is then processed and the encoder is calibrated automatically .

At this point , the encoder is placed in the normal operational mode and no further calibrat ions will normally be required .

      " 187 The International Space Station Solar Alpha Rotary Joint Anomaly Investigation Elliot P. Harik * , Justin McFatter * , Daniel J. Sweeney * * , Carlos F. Enriquez * , Deneen M. Taylor * * and David S. McCann * Abstract The Solar Alpha Rotary Joint ( SARJ ) is a single-axis pointing mechanism used to orient the solar power generating arrays relative to the sun for the International Space Station ( ISS ) . Approximately 83 days after its on-orbit installation , one of the two SARJ mechanisms aboard the ISS began to exhibit high drive motor current draw . Increased structural vibrations near the joint were also observed . Subsequent inspections via Extravehicular Activity ( EVA ) discovered that the nitrided case-hardened steel bearing race on the outboard side of the joint had extensive damage to one of its three rolling surfaces . A farreaching investigation of the anomaly was undertaken . The investigation included metallurgical inspections , coupon tests , traction kinematics tests , detailed bearing measurements , and thermal and structural analyses . The results of the investigation showed that the anomaly had most probably been caused by high bearing edge stresses that resulted from inadequate lubrication of the rolling contact . The profile of the roller bearings and the metallurgical properties of the race ring were also found to be significant contributing factors . To mitigate the impact of the damage , astronauts cleaned and lubricated , control of the inhabited volume of the ISS is a precise balancing act between electrical power input from the PVA and waste heat rejection through the radiator panels . An additional requirement of the active thermal control system is to maintain a uniform temperature on critical parts of the ISS structure such as habitat interfaces and airlocks . The energy balance of the system is illustrated in Figure 1 . The thermal control system is symmetric having independent port and starboard loops . Although flight rules dictate that both systems shall run at all times , there is limited redundancy on the ISS such that limited operation is possible with only one functional loop . The working fluid in the heat rejection system is high-pressure liquid , anhydrous ammonia at a nominal system pressure and temperature of 2.62 MPa and 275 K ( 380 psia , 36/g113F ) . Additional components of the system are shown in Figure 2 . The specific arrangements of the components of the active thermal control system are also shown in the figure . The pump module is an Orbital Replacement Unit ( ORU ) designed so that it could be exchanged with spare units during an * NASA Glenn Research Center , Cleveland , OH , USA , performed several paperstudies1'2investigating theutilityofvarious levelsofsatellite servicing capability .

The 4-point bearing establishes axial position of the cam tube . A set of small , axially-acting springs preloads one raceway . The springs are housed on the backside of this raceway in a radial pattern of blind holes with a precise depth to protect the springs from over-compression . This scheme allows for adjustment of the total spring force by varying the number of springs installed . The 3-point bearing provides moment stability for the cam tube while allowing for axial compliance . Custom ball separators ,.\n",
