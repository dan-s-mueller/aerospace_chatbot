    For access to a demo of this chatbot, please reach out to `dsm@danmueller.pro <mailto:dsm@danmueller.pro>`__ for an invite link.

This chatbot is utilizes Aerospace Mechanisms Symposia papers as input back to 2020. You can see all of the papers which are indexed to the chatbot `here <https://github.com/dan-s-mueller/aerospace_chatbot/tree/main/data/AMS>`__. 

The `Aerospace Mechanisms Symposia <https://aeromechanisms.com/>`__ papers in PDF form going back to the year 1966 with a release every 1-2 years. Each symposia release has roughly 20-40 papers detailing design, test, analysis, and lessons learned for space mechanism design. The full paper index for past symposia is available `here <https://aeromechanisms.com/paper-index/>`__.

The symposia papers are a valuable resource for the aerospace community, but the information is locked in PDF form and not easily searchable. This example demonstrates how to query, search, and ask a Large Language Model (LLM) questions about the content in these papers.

A key feature of this tool is returning source documentation when the LLM provides an answer. This improves trust, enables verification, and allows users to read the original source material.

To explore the functionality of this tool, a list of questions based on the content in the papers indexed using `Ragas synthetic testset generation <https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/getstarted/testset_generation.html>`__ was generated and is shown below. See :doc:`eval` for details.
