    "text": "iii PREFACE    The Aerospace Mechanisms Symposium (AMS) provides a unique forum for those active in the design, production and use of aerospace mechanisms. A major focus is the reporting of problems and solutions associated with the development and flight certification of new mechanisms. Sponsored and o rganized by the Mechanisms  Education Association, responsibility for hosting the AMS is shared by the National Aeronautics and Space Administr ation and Lockheed Martin Space .    The 46 th AMS was scheduled to be held in Houston, Texas  but unfortunately, the  worldwide COVID- 19 pandemic led us to holding the symposium virtually on May 11- 13,  2022. These proceedings are published to provide these lessons learned and mechanism design information to the mechanism community. Topics included  instrument  mechanisms, release devices , sensors , tribology , actuators and cubesat   mechanisms .    The high quality of this symposium is a result of the work of many people, and their",

ARGOS achieves six degree of freedom motion using an  active XYZ system similar to a bridge crane whereas rotational degrees of freedom are passively managed by a gimballing mechanism at the payload  interface. ARGOS\u2019 control system continuously tracks and offloads of a  percentage of a human or robotic payload\u2019s weight during a wide range of  partial gravity and microgravity activities. The facility supports surface  operation studies, suit and vehicle requirements development, suit and  vehicle design evaluation, robotic development, mass handling studies, and crew training with both suited and shirt- sleeved subjects.   1:15 PDT: End of Day 1",

This custom-designed vacuum cover mechanism utilized a metallic H-seal to meet stringent leak  and cleanliness requirements. The cover also relied on a significantly scaled-down version of heritage  clamprings to provide retention of the high seal loads prior to deployment. Due to the fine measurement  capability of the MASPEX instrument, a hermetic actuation device and minimal non-metallic components  and finishes were used.

This leak  requirement is equivalent or greater than the best commercially available static seals, and is at the noise  floor of most helium leak detectors. The MASPEX cover is required to maintain a hermetic seal to ensure  that the instrument remains free of contaminants to protect the sample for subsequent error-free analysis.

System-level requirement updates necessitated design changes to the primary sealing  interface late in the program. The updated design passed all helium leak checks, sealing to levels <1*10^- 8 Pa*l /sec helium leak throughout all environmental tests. Several challenges were overcome throughout  the development of this hermetically sealed cover system including management of deployable sealed  interfaces, integrating miniaturized clamprings, minimal use of non-metallics, and application of undercenter linkages. All these challenges resulted in invaluable technology advancement that can be applied to",

The mechanism is useful in applications where angular orientation of the platform in three-dimensional  space needs to be controlled over a typical angular range of \u00b120 degrees. This mechanism comprises three  linear actuators traveling along parallel axes and a platform supported by three joints at the ends of the  actuators. The lack of a rigid lateral constraint within the magnetic joint enables the capability of platform to  change orientation via the point contact interfaces.

Conventional mechanisms such as gimbal mounts, hexapods, and others are frequently  pushed towards higher performance. Typical performance parameters include actuation range, speed,  pointing accuracy, and cost.   The actuation speed of all mechanical systems is fundamentally limited by the moving mass of the payload  and the actuation mechanism. A major advantage of the laterally unconstrained magnetic joint is the  minimization of the parasitic moving mass required to actuate the platform. This in turn results in a higher  actuation speed and lower cost. Increased reliability may be achieved through simplification and reduced  component count.

Harmonic drives are chosen for their compact size, high gear output  ratios, and minimal backlash / hysteresis, which are all key elements to meet the actuator design  requirements. In some instances, a series of two harmonic drives are used in actuators that require very  high output resolution.   Actuator Rotary to Linear Output Assembly (RLOA)  The key element to our linear actuator design is a highly engineered rotary to linear output assembly. This  completely flexure-based design takes the rotary output motion from the final harmonic drive and translates  it into pure linear motion.

Optional Feedback Devices  The modular actuator design allows for optional feedback devices to be integrated if the application  requires.

The predictive model is characterized fully.   Introduction  Shape Memory Alloys (SMA) such as nitinol are among the highest energy density actuators [1-2], with  nitinol displaying controllable properties during use. Significant research has been performed to  characterize the actuation of linear nitinol systems [3-6], but accurate prediction of flat plate SMA actuation  under bending conditions has been limited in both scope and application [7-9].

This ensured the solution process will arrive at the boundary temperature. The  Neumann constant heat flux boundary conditions were imposed by setting the boundary-side, off-diagonal  coefficient to zero and updating the volumetric thermal capacitance term to reflect the reduction in crosssectional area. Deriving the nodal equations for all nodes yields a large, nearly tri-diagonal set of linear  equations suited for a TDMA solution [18]. The inherent non-linearity associated with radiation heat transfer  necessitates an iterative approach to ensure the simulation arrives at the correct temperature distribution.  Thus, once a solution was obtained from the TDMA, the resulting temperature field was used to re-calculate  the source term, and the TDMA was again applied.

Depending on the time step and  spatial resolution selected, the system memory requirements of the above heat transfer model can become  very large.

By saving  only the needed time steps of these variables, the memory requirements of the heat transfer model were  significantly reduced.

Current switches that rely on electro-mechanical technology are not very reliable and are sensitive to  mounting orientation, to thermal gradients, and have a limited number of operational cycles, which is a  problem for long life application, launch vibrations and shock loads.  Micro-switches relying on contact, as well as relay reeds, provide additional resistive torque that has to be  overcome by the mechanism actuator, having a negative impact on the motorization margins.",

The sensing head is located at the tip of a cylindrical body which provides an M16 fastening interface over  the complete body length, and which also provides the housing for the embedded conditioning electronics.  This design has been proposed in order to provide cost efficiency, as well as simple integration onto  structures with precise sensing clearances adjustment, and easy electrical connection to a distant power  source without requiring any remote signal conditioning.

Axial motion micro-switch design (left) and tangential motion micro-switch design (right)  The sensor operates with a push-pull voltage output, which provides a digital output indicating the proximity  of a target located onto a moving part. A high level (VOUT = VCC) means that the target is far from the  sensor and a low level (VOUT = GND) means that the target close to the sensor.   The approach of a high output level when the target is far from the sensor was defined for safety concerns,  in case of sensor failure. If a failure does occur, the output is set to low level, as if indicating the proximity  of the target is in front of the sensor, in such a way that the mechanism motion can be stopped to avoid a  collision, in order to activate a redundant sensor.

Qualification runs will  cover functional tests at ambient and operational temperatures, vibrations and shock environments, EMC  and radiation tests.  The maturation of CTEC space ECS technology was possible thanks to CNES and ESA support funding,  which have allowed the development of relevant and compact sensing solutions in the field of fine pointing  and fine positioning applications, which are currently being launched as off the shelf space products. The  reader is invited to evaluate the application of CTEC ECS sensors technologies in the proposed references,  especially in the field of new space applications, large size constellations, and pointing mirror mechanisms.

To support the deployable panels of the antenna during launch, each assembly  has six restrain-release mechanisms. Both satellites deployed the SAR antenna panels in orbit succesfully.

This design was born from the  popularity of small, inexpensive Nichrome burn wire solutions in the small satellite community, coupled with  some associated failures of those devices that revealed the opportunity for a more reliable solution. EBAD  adapted our GEO NEA\u00ae battery bypass switch into an HDRM for small sat applications, built and tested an  initial prototype.

The release mechanism in the  bypass switch (Figure 1) is similar in operation to our standard release mechanisms and utilizes the same  patented fuse wire technology. This combination resulted in the development of a scaled down version of  the HDRM that is less than a cubic inch (16 mL) in volume, yet capable of holding a functional load of at  least 1110 N (250 lbf) while producing the same low shock characteristics expected of EBAD\u2019s NEA\u00ae HDRMs.   Figure 1.

Functional loads of at least 250 lbf are achievable with the updated Mini design.  2. Shock Output of the mechanism is well below expectations and industry standards.  3. The Mini devices successfully operate in extreme heat and cold space environments.  4. Miniature size mechanisms in general present manufacturing and test challenges that require  special tooling and fixturing.  5. Very small fasteners (#1) present issues in machining, assembly, and test. The release rod was  therefore upsized to a #4-40.  6. Upgrading to metallic parts from plastic increased the load and thermal capabilities of the device  with minimal impact to cost.   7. Upgrading to metallic parts introduced a ground path that needed to be mitigated.   8. Units with no ground path mitigation function as designed.   References",

When the device  requires predictable fracture or permanent deformation of structural elements, the dynamics and non-linear  responses of the structural elements play a significant role in the overall performance of the pyrotechnic  device. Examples of such devices are pyrotechnic cutters and pyrotechnic valves. For the pyrotechnic  cutter, the material responses of the blade and the target, and for the pyrovalve, the fracturing of the material  to open up the flow passage, have significant impact on the overall design of the device. These material  responses are highly non-linear and transient so detailed strength and fracture models for such events are  often not available. However, simplified models grounded in strategically designed engineering tests can",

This is  especially true with a space private sector growing rapidly and offering new technologies and approaches  which result in a revolution with regards to the costs of spacecraft launch and payload capabilities. Those  implications are going to be reflected in the design philosophy \u2013 less conservative design, accepting larger  risk, and introducing technologies with no space heritage.

One of the  most effective methods to mitigate the risk of new space debris generation is its end-of-life utilization. A  deorbiting SRM with a TVC system is one potential solution. The main advantages of using a dedicated  deorbiting system based on an SRM are: relatively high density performance, low system complexity,  storability and autonomy [1] [2]. By adding TVC to an SRM, a deorbiting system gains better control over  an end-of-life maneuver: its attitude and orientation, ensuring that the final trajectory would be performed  accurately and safely.

Conclusion  The most suitable method of thrust vectoring for a deorbitation propulsion system based on the SRM is a  concept with outside flaps. The proposed mechanism, inspired by a Fowler mechanism used commonly in  aviation to extend flaps on a wing, is a promising concept. The design introduces a number of benefits, i.e.,  relatively low envelop size, adjustable design (potential for optimization for different driving parameters)  and necessity to actuate only flaps and associated levers (unlike a gimbal where entire motor needs to be  moved).

It  provides a \u00b15-degree cone, with its rotation axis lateral to the flight direction. A two independent axis  configuration has been implemented, where each actuation subassembly provides a rotation around one  of the axes. While the actuation is fixed to the TPM structure, both axes include two supporting points via  two opposed flex pivots. To take advantage of the space available in the corners of the assigned volume,  the axes are in an \u201cX\u201d configuration with respect to a typical 12U Cubesat body\u2019s dimensions, as shown in  Figure 4.

Unlike on Earth, and in absence of a complex levelling mechanism, a 3Dmeasurement is required for full gravity vector reconstruction. Two gravimeter axes, aligned orthogonally,  and the rotation of the instrument sensor heads, in which the gravimeter spring is placed, realize this. The  rotation of the spring also allows for instrument bias rejection, similar to the quasi-steady acceleration  measurement (QSAM) instrument for spacecraft that inverted the measurement direction by 180\u00b0 [8].  Therefore, the mechanism rotation is crucial to the experiments success.

In this case,  a maximum of 40-nm rms RWE at 0\u00b0 mirror surface flatness is the target (corresponding to a 20-nm rms  optical surface flatness). To ensure that the specification would be reached, CTEC used tools developed  for previous space optical mechanisms projects.

Introduction  CubeSats are a standard for small satellites developed by CalPoly, with each unit (or U) measuring 10 cm  x 10 cm x 10 cm. Relatively low price and complexity of CubeSats have led to an increase of popularity in  recent years. As their popularity continues to grow demand for propulsion systems with higher delta-V has  increased to expand the capabilities of CubeSats. [1] Higher delta-V capabilities would be able to reach  higher orbits and greatly increases the versatility of CubeSats. Hydrazine has been a commonly used  monopropellant for small satellite propulsion but is known for its high toxicity. In response to the toxic nature  of hydrazine, the Air Force Research Laboratory developed the green monopropellant called AF-M315E,  also known as ASCENT. In addition to its lower toxicity, AF-M315E has a higher theoretical specific impulse",

If the backside of the plunger is in a sealed space, the pressure drawdown from moving  the plunger down would quickly overtake the force the motors could exert on the plunger. The team  considered using a volatile fluid, such as acetone, to fill a buffer space above the plunger, as shown in  Figure 3. As the volume in the buffer zone would increase, the fluid would evaporate and pressurize the  buffer space, reducing the effect of the pressure drawdown. The team found that this solution would not  entirely fix the drawdown issue. Instead, the backside of the plunger will be exposed to the vacuum of  space. With this setup, the plunger will be working with the vacuum rather than against it during hot fires.   Figure 3. Diagram depicting the proposed buffer area in an earlier GMPE design.",

First, the motor\u2019s torque output, T, the  diameter of the shaft, d, gear reduction, N, and efficiency, \u03b7 were used to find the motor\u2019s force output, F.

The first is the  simplest case where no misalignment is present, and no torque is created as the force passes through the  center of gravity. Misalignment in one plane (Figure 5) is referred to as \u201csimple misalignment\u201d while a  misalignment in two planes is referred to as \u201ccomplex misalignment.\u201d These misalignments are likely to  occur as a result of slight imperfections during the manufacturing process.

Great care must be taken to balance the internal forces, including: the pull force of the SMA wire,  spring forces to release the nut and reset the device, and frictional forces between sliding  components.   5.

However, the space vacuum environment is devoid of humidity and moisture. A retainer  fabricated and measured in a typical manufacturing environment shrinks when placed in a vacuum and  expands with increases in humidity. If the bearing retainer shrinks sufficiently in the vacuum, along with  thermal expansion and contraction, it can create an interference fit on the inner ring of the bearing. This  condition can result in excessive bearing drag torque and in extreme case, possible cage failure.

Stubbs* and Jason T. Galary*  Abstract  Lubricants play a critical role in ensuring that mechanisms perform reliably under the demanding operating  conditions found in space. Known for their chemical inertness, broad operating temperature range, and low  volatility, perfluoropolyethers (PFPEs) are attractive lubricants for space applications. The one Achilles Heel  of PFPEs is their susceptability to Lewis acid-catalyzed degradation, also known as the \u201cBrown Sugar\u201d  effect, which can negatively impact the wear life of a lubricant.   However, not all PFPEs have the same chemical structure, making some PFPEs more susceptible to Lewis  acid-catalyzed degradation than others.

The data collected demonstrates the cause of the Brown Sugar effect and enables  engineers to make informed decisions when selecting lubricants for space mechanisms.  Introduction  Background  PFPE-based oils and greases have been go-to solutions for lubrication in space applications for over fifty  years [1]. The inherent properties of these fluids make them a good fit for the space environment; their  attributes include low vapor pressures and outgassing, broad operating temperature range, and chemical  inertness. Their broad operating temperature range is especially important for lubricants in space, not only  due to extreme sweeps in ambient temperature conditions, but also due to limited opportunities for heat  transfer and dissipation in a vacuum environment. PFPEs offer the highest thermal stability of available  base oils and thus are best equipped to withstand the localized high temperatures generated at frictional  contacts [1\u20133].",

The severity of the reduction in film durability did not correlate with the duration of exposure,  i.e., long exposures to humid air were not more impactful to film durability than were short exposures.  Introduction  The purpose of this work was to study the effect and exposure to humid air on the durability of a MoS 2 dry  film lubricant (DFL) on spur gears operated in vacuum. This study was motivated by the JWST Mission. It  is one part of a NASA Engineering Safety Center effort to evaluate potential risks and performance effects  to JWST instrument mechanisms and components lubricated with sputtered MoS 2 films. This effort  employed both spiral orbit tribometer and gear experiments. Gear teeth experience a unique combination",

A previous  investigation was conducted using a similar MoS 2 DFL supplied by a domestic vendor [1], referred to as  gear set #1. Test specimen gears used in this investigation, gear set #2, were prepared by applying a pure  (not nanocomposite-type) MoS 2 DFL to case-carburized steel gears via sputtering. Specimens were then  subjected to a brief run-in procedure (100 cycles) in vacuum followed by controlled exposure to a humid air  environment at 60% RH for durations ranging from 10 to 326 days.",

During deployment of the antennas, the temperature may be as low as -70\u00b0C. There is a limited amount of  data available regarding potential lubricants for operation at such low temperatures. Extrapolation of this  data indicated that they could potentially provide the desired lubricating action, but the uncertainty was high  so testing was performed to confirm the behavior of the lubricants at these temperatures.   At low temperatures, the viscosity of lubricants can increase by orders of magnitude. Because oil does not  crystallize, or solidify, at any temperature, it technically does not freeze.

It was  possible that the spring force available in the actuators would not be sufficient to overcome the lowtemperature bearing resistance. We were confident that if the bearing was able to start turning, the shearing  action in the lubricant would warm it locally, decreasing its viscosity, allowing the rolling action of the  bearings to continue reliably. Therefore, we focused on measuring just the starting torque at various cold  temperatures. These experimental measurements confirmed that the available mechanism torque was well  above the measured starting torque even at temperatures that were colder than our expected worst-case  cold deployment conditions. In addition, the testing confirmed that the volume of lubricant selected was  appropriate for the short-duration one-time operation of the devices containing the tested bearing types.",

When torque is  applied, one disk rotates a small amount relative to the other disk and the rods bend slightly. This relative  rotational deflection is proportional to the applied torque, and is measured optically. It required about 0.5  deg of rotation to wind up this torsional spring before the torque reached the starting torque being measured.

This ensured  that there were no dynamic effects during the wind-up leading to startup in which the two rings of the bearing  started to move relative to one another.

Since the expected operating  temperature of these bearings during deployment of the radar antennas of the REASON instrument could  be below the rated temperature, we measured starting torque down to lower temperatures. These  measurements retired a risk that the oil might increase in viscosity and cause more bearing drag than the  mechanism could overcome at low temperatures.

The idea is to use Mars winds to  produce electrical energy and use it as an auxiliary energy source to solar cells during the Martian storms  and continue low electric supply during the storms. However, the usual Electromagnetic Generators (EG)  are unsuitable for planetary exploration due to their heavyweight, leading to the high launch costs. The  alternative to EG can be the Triboelectric Generator (TEG), which produces more power than an EG when  weight and volume are considered as key parameters [1][2]. This paper describes the operation principles,  trade-off developments, and results of a first approach to implement the first wind turbine tests based on a  TEG for Mars.  Even though on Mars there are wind seasons with high-speed winds, the atmosphere density is very low.  It is not obvious that a wind turbine would move under those conditions.

The main difference between  both types of turbines is that VAWTs are crossflow devices and accept wind from any direction while in  HAWTs the rotor must be kept perpendicular to the flow of the wind which means that it must be oriented  to capture the maximum energy from the wind. Moreover, in VAWTs the components may be connected  directly to the rotor shaft and located at the ground level. This eliminates the need for a tower to support  the weight of equipment such as the gearbox and other main turbine components. Due to the extreme  weather, the Martian dust and the weight limitations, the absence of the orientation mechanism and the  ease of operation, maintenance and installation are the key aspects when choosing the type of turbine for  this application. Therefore, a vertical axis wind turbine best meets the requirements.  Design of the wind turbine",

Considering that the larger the swept area the higher the power  output and that there is less margin in terms of height, the rotor height has been set to its maximum value,  that is H=0.7 m. Then, the diameter has been adjusted, considering the aspect ratio. Reviewing [8][9], it is  concluded that if blade tip losses are considered, high aspect ratio values should be used. If the structural  aspect is also considered, aspect ratio values between 2.5 and 3 are recommended.

There are multiple ways that dust can damage a piece of hardware. The first type is dust entering the gaps  between elements in rigid-body mechanisms. Such intrusion, due to the characteristics of the regolith,  described further in the next section, increases the friction of kinematic pairs and, in some cases, can jam  them completely. The traditional approach is to seal the joints from the dusty environment. However, as  Apollo\u2019s experience showed, the abrasive characteristics of the Lunar dust tend to break seals [1].

Certain characteristics of the Lunar environment and regolith (discussed later in  this section) lead to a large build-up and retention of charge. This build-up of charge causes particles to  adhere easily to surfaces and may also cause the dust to float above the surface having easier access to  mission hardware.

The  transfer of charge under contact serves to change the material\u2019s work functions and bring them into  alignment, effectively equalizing the surface potentials of the two materials. Insulating materials do not have  work functions, as they by definition do not have free electrons at their surface. It has been found however  that insulators in contact with metals exhibit charge transfer proportional to the work function of the  contacting metal [8,9].

When a particle is charged triboelectrically against a conducting surface, it has been shown that the  resultant surface charge density is inversely proportional to the particle\u2019s size [10]. This relationship means  that smaller dust particles in the Lunar regolith will charge to a very high charge-to-mass ratio (specific  charge).

A key point worth highlighting is that prior to the ASTP, in-space docking mechanisms were of  designs which relied on prescriptive male and female geometry (e.g., probe/cone), meaning that mating  pairs of vehicles always had to have the right combination of geometry to achieve docking.

The final estimate of loads in the pump were large enough to potentially shorten the life of  hydrodynamic bearings.  Magnetic forces could be attributed to the magnetic runouts of both the rotor and stator and were measured  experimentally with different variations of a test setup utilizing a single magnetic element to characterize  the magnetic field over a full rotation of the component.

However, the bending is pretty low as compare with the traditional extandable scissor structure  (see Fig. 11).
