Hermetic Sealing  - H-seals and conflat seals are ideal for hermetically sealing interfaces, especially when metal on metal  interfaces are required.   - It is critical that the sealing surface of H-seal and knife-edge interface are pristine surfaces free of burrs,  nicks, and markings.   - Knife-edge interfaces need to be able to fully engage with the sealing surface.  - When loading H-seals onto a knife-edge, the seal needs to come down consistently perpendicular to  the surface plane. The seal cannot be rocked or unevenly engaged onto knife-edge during loading.  o For deployable mechanisms, this means compliance for the seal to come down perpendicular,  and not on an extended radius from a hinge line (if applicable).  Clampring  - When tensioning a clampring with an under-center link, the majority of loading occurs during the initial  movement of the linkage. There is limited load adjustability once the under-center linkage is near its  end of travel towards the over-center condition.  - Variability in ring ODs, even by .025 mm (.001 in), greatly affects the final tension in the clampring.  Those features need to be very tightly controlled to get repeatable results between mechanisms.   Helium Leak Testing  - It is critical to minimize all potential interfaces when testing minimal levels of Helium in the system.  - Excess background helium needs to be cleared from the immediate area of a leak detector  - The leak detector needs to be in pristine condition to measure at noise floor.

The seal cannot be rocked or unevenly<br>engaged onto knife-edge during loading.  o For deployable mechanisms, this means<br>compliance for the seal to come down perpendicular,  and not on an extended<br>radius from a hinge line (if applicable).  Clampring  - When tensioning a<br>clampring with an under-center link, the majority of loading occurs during the<br>initial  movement of the linkage. There is limited load adjustability once the<br>under-center linkage is near its  end of travel towards the over-center<br>condition.  - Variability in ring ODs, even by .025 mm (.001 in), greatly<br>affects the final tension in the clampring.  Those features need to be very<br>tightly controlled to get repeatable results between mechanisms.
