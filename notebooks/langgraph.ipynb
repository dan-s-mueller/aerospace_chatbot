DESIGN ISSUES\\n\\nThe basic design problem was to create a device that could utilize a very low energy signal to release a relatively large load of IOKN while addressing the above issues. The overall device comprised several basic components:\\n\\n{ The “prime mover” which converts electrical energy to mechanical\\n\\nmechanism performance and verify forces and margins within the mechanism.

Among these are piezo-electric components, motors, solenoids, and shape memory alloy (SMA) components. Of these components SMA in the form of wire has the best combination of features for this type of device. For this design a wire .2 mm in diameter and 50 mm long was chosen.\\n\\nFigure 1.

While presentation and discussion of all of the development and qualification test results are beyond the scope of this paper, significant results that relate to the basic operational capabilities follow.\\n\\n3. DESIGN ISSUES\\n\\nThe basic design problem was to create a device that could utilize a very low energy signal to release a relatively large load of IOKN while addressing the above issues. The overall device comprised several basic components:\\n\\n{ The “prime mover” which converts electrical energy to mechanical\\n\\npyro shock Resettability / reusability High reliability mechanism\\n\\n(No ( (\\n\\n2. OPERATIONAL ISSUES\\n\\nTypically separation nuts are released through the action of gas generated through detonation of a pyrotechnic charge. The safe and effective use of a pyrotechnic mechanism is based on some very strict handling protocol.\\n\\n3.3 Latch Elements\\n\\nWhile the torque to release the mechanism has been reduced to a relatively low level, it still is not low enough to rotate directly using the SMA wire. Rather than attempt to drive the release directly with the SMA wire, the approach of using the SMA to trigger a self- driving release latch is used.\\n\\n5. CONCLUSIONS\\n\\nThe overall conclusion is that the MHRM design is viable.\\n\\nIn summary the performance is as follows:\\n\\n{\\n\\n_ non-pyrotechnic release\\n\\n{mass including Thermal Knives: approximately 0.2 kg\\n\\n( envelope: 38 (height) by 50 by 250 mm, including Thermal Knives and electrical wiring.\\n\\n{ _ simple installation of application by bolting to top of Reel\\n\\n_ _ _\\n\\nRelease of the mechanism consists of rotating the latch arm with the SMA trigger wires until the toggles are no longer constrained radially. Once the latch arm has rotated clear, the toggles move outward and the outer race rotates toward the released position as described above. Figure 2 shows a cross section showing the basic latch components.\\n\\nDuring the development and qualification of the release mechanism, a large number of functional and environmental tests were performed. A qualification test series was performed consisting of typical spacecraft environmental tests and interspersed functional tests to monitor performance. During development testing similar environmental tests were performed along with a number of tests to assess\\n\\n4. OVERALL DESIGN FEATURES\\n\\nFigure 3 is a photograph of the Qwknut and the bolt retractor/catcher in the configuration that has been qualified.\\n\\nThe mechanism release side consists of:\\n\\n{ SMA wire triggers — the mechanism is triggered by redundant SMA wires as described above\\n\\n( Rotary release latch — The triggers rotate the latch arm to initiate outer race rotation\\n---\\n', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})]\n",
