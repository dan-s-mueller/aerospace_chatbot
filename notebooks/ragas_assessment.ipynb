       "Document(page_content='Figure 6. Bearing Race-Ball Dent Fixture.  Results and Discussions The single ball versus race static load capacity of a hybrid Si 3N4-60NiTi bearing was evaluated and the  results are shown in Table 2. In the table, the dent depth, dent depth normalized by the ball diameter, the  peak stress, and the mean stress are listed. The normalized dent depth as a function of mean stress is plotted in Figure 7. The dent depth data for the ball-race contact agrees reasonably well with the more generalized ball-flat  plate dent depth data collected previously (Ref. 8). This agreement, despite differences in contact geometry, further support the argument that the Hertz stress relations for contacting bodies can be  confidently applied to bearing design. Using the generally accepted dent depth criteria (dp/D~0.00003 to  0.00010), the data indicate that the damage threshold for 60NiTi is around 2.8 to 3.3 GPa. This is slightly lower than the value estimated from flat plate dent studies but within data scatter and is to be considered in good agreement. Further experiments with additional race sizes are warranted to narrow the stress limit more precisely. For the present, a reasonable stress limit, when designing bearings to withstand high  static load, is 3.1 GPa. In the section that follows, a notional spacecraft mechanism, a small reaction wheel assembly (RWA), will  be assessed to determine how the substitution of 60NiTi for steel in the bearings can affect the ability to withstand the rigorous launch vibration load environment. Through such an assessment it is hoped that  pathways to performance improvement, weight reduction or enhanced robustness will be revealed. 79 Table 2.

      "[ragas.testset.evolutions.DEBUG] answer generated: {'answer': \"The spectral resolution of an FTS is a function of the maximum optical path difference (OPD), and the quality of the spectra is critically dependent upon the uniformity of the moving cube corner's motion. The Michelson interferometer splits the incoming radiation and sends it down two arms with different path lengths. When the two beams recombine, interference occurs. By varying the optical path length difference between the two arms of the interferometer, the incoming light is interferometrically modulated. The different wavelengths present in the radiation are modulated at different frequencies. So applying a Fourier transform to the interferogram produces a spectrum of light absorption levels vs. wavelength and reveals the composition of the observed atmosphere.\", 'verdict': '1'}\n",
